## Detection of blood sugar level in diabetes diagnosis
#### Do you want to check your blood sugar levels?

### Purposes
<div style=" font-size:20px">
- Figure out what factors could affect the blood sugar of diabetics.
- Compare out what algorithm works the best in prediction blood sugar problem of diabetic.
- Find out what method we could use to collect patient blood sugar.
</div>


### Who can use?

<div style=" font-size:20px">
The patient who has diabetes or anyone who wants test their own blood sugar.
</div>

## Dataset and Data Science Process

### Data Science Process:
Design a shiny app to collect the blood sugar, height, weight, blood pressure  ...  
From the date we collect we could combine the blood situation and personal detail to analyze the patient status and provided health status and predict the high risk.

We can see that diabetes is more closely related to Glucose, Blood Pressure and BMI.Note: 0 = Not Diabetic and 1 = Diabetic.


## Summary of Experience 

The dataset consists about 768 recipes and consists of 8 attributes in the original datasets

- How to check blood glucose levels and make health judgments
- Process the data ready for modelling by using different libraries in RStudio.
- Understand and build up the shiny app architecture.
